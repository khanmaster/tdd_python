# Test Driven Development TDD

- Let's dive into coding 
- we have already completed step 1 and 2
- let's create a file called calc_test.pty
- we will use `unittest` and `pytest`
- `pip install pytest`
- `python -m unittest`
- `python -m unittest discover -v`


# TDD Test Driven Development 
## Type of testing
- unit testing
- TDD

### Python has several modules that we can use 
to test our code
- pytest
- unittest

**Why TDD**
- TDD helps us minimise the risk of failure before sending the product to production 

**steps**
- we will create a file to write our tests
- we will run the test they will all fail
- we will create a file to write our code
- we will refactor and add the code to pass the tests

**Naming convention for test files and methods**
- file name simple_calc
- test_simple_calc
 
** install the testing frameworks**

```python
pip install pytest
```

- How does ```pytest``` work

- pytest looks for the files with ``` test_*.py``` and ```_test*.py```
- ```-v``` is vor verbose flag

- We can use different condition with assertEqual as per business need

**TDD Task**
- Create a new Repo on gihub
- Create a new project in pycharm
- name tdd_test_task
- create a file to write tests
- create a file to write code
- implement sudo coding
- create a README to document the steps to successfully achieve the task

- create a test to check is the number divisible/remainder 0 if True pass the test if False fail
- create a class and method to write code to pass the test

- create a test to check if the given values are positive 
- create a method in the class to pass the test
